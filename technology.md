# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Python will be used to merge the two data tables and then create two new data tables specific to the stats that we are analyzing. Further analysis will also be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
We used SQL to combine our databases together. SQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is comparing happiness vs. life expectancy and happiness vs. suicide rates. Our goal was to create a trend line to figure out if happiness directly correlates with a given nationâ€™s life expectancy and suicide rate.

## Dashboard
We used Tableau for our dashboard. This allowed us to create three graphs (Happiness vs. Life Expectancy in Men, Happiness vs. Life Expectancy in Women,  Happiness vs. Suicide Rate, GDP vs. Happiness, and an interactive map showing happiness scores per county).
